This year, I hope to show Greenway that being a NHS member is more than just something to put on a college application. NHS signifies more than just 28 hours a year — it’s a commitment to our school, our community, and most importantly, ourselves.  National Honor Society members can represent the part of the school that we as a community are most proud of. They can represent the difference between right and wrong. Action and inaction.

And, service and character can mean a variety of things. I’ve learned that it can be totally spontaneous, like picking up a piece of trash on your way to class or holding a door open for someone. 
</p><p class = "bio comment">
Since I joined my Girl Scout troop in 2008, I have been tirelessly committed to school and community involvement.

The past 3 years of high school have taught me a lot. They have helped me recognize the importance of community, friendship, and leadership. Most importantly, though, they have shown me how these communities and friendships operate.
</p><p class = "bio comment">
This year, we will be working hard to expand Greenway’s NHS program to a wider scope than before. With a larger student body, committed officers, and more emphasis on organization, I believe that we can give this group of hard-working students greater opportunities to benefit their communities through service and leadership.
</p><p class = "bio comment">
Additionally, I’ve set up this website for this year. If you have any comments/suggestions related to the website, feel free to contact me.

As officers for this year’s NHS, our goal is to increase our efficiency and organization. This means creating a system that allows members to check their hours regularly, updating members on community service opportunities, and other like actions. 
</p><p class = "bio comment">
Our goal for the organization as a whole is to prove that NHS is more than its hour and grade requirements — more than the sum of its parts. NHS is a personal commitment to comporting yourself with the values of NHS irrespective of the time or place. 
</p><p class = "bio comment">
I have the rare privilege of being your NHS officer this year and I hope together we can work to better our community at school and abroad.
